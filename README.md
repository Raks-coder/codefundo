We are planing to build an early typoon/cyclone detection system, the idea to train a model to detect the type of tornado in the input picture and tell the severity of typoon.

It will allow the user to find out the category the tornado belongs to by taking its picture.

The user will take a picture and submit that picture online to the server via web interface, the web-server with the picture the to backend server for classification and procesing. The predicted type of the tornado is returned to the user via web-interface. Initially, web interface will be used, but later native Android and iOS apps will be created to allow easy and convinient access for getting results

We are planing to use some publically available dataset on cyclone, historical meteorological data of different location.
