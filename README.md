# Relief Shelter

When a natural disaster strikes a place, there is a need to provide shelters to people who get affected by it. We plan to create an app which will allow people looking for a place to stay can get connected to people who are willing to offer a safe place for them

There will be SMS sending facility and Emergency button to send the location, in case of non-availability of internet services.
If  GPS location is not accessible to send live location then there will functionality to type the whole address.


Technologies: App Development IDE like VisualStudio or AndriodStudio
