# Relief Shelter

When a natural disaster strikes a place, there is a need to provide shelters to people who get affected by it. We plan to create an app which will allow people looking for a place to stay can get connected to people who are willing to offer a safe place for them

There will be SMS sending facility and Emergency button to send the location, in case of non-availability of internet services.
GPS location will be used to locate near by shelters. If GPS is not available then, the user can send SMS with the location and he will recieve the near by shelters within the app.

In case shelters are not available in, say, 5 KMs radius, the user who needs shelter can request one through the app. These kind of requests will be updated in realtime so that this information can be used by people, NGOs or government to organize shelters in a better way.
